## Introduction


This is a project that targeted to run on MicroBit with [Yahboom Omni:bit](https://category.yahboom.net/collections/micro-bit/products/omni-bit) via a [Yahboom micro:bit Game Handle](https://category.yahboom.net/collections/micro-bit/products/basicgamehandle)
It behaves similar to the official solution but with a much more graceful and cleaner solution.
